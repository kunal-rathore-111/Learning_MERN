// DOM manipulation 

// javasript is the implementation which has to follow ECMASCRIPT , where ECMASCRIPR was the documentation

// setTimeout(), fetch() -> are not in ECMASCRIPT it was in WebApis

// Let's create a simple website which calculates the sum of two inputs


// In CSS we had two things, classes and ids but ids are used with javascript to access elements via DOM Apis


// To make website dynamic we need js (most specific DOM needs)

// document <- is used to access complete element of html and manipulate them


// debouncing and throtlling -> debounce is used to make a backend call automatically after a specific time and if the backend has another call under that specific time then the prev. call will be cancelled and the another call will be called after the specific time
